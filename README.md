# About Pie++
Pie++ (or "p3" for short) is a Chrome extension that adds some much-needed quality of life features to Indiana University's internal tool PIE (Personnel Information Environment) including:
- WIP
Features to be implemented in the future include:
- Seamlessly download queried historical data to a local file (e.g. CSV or JSON), such as Inventory Reports, Location Evaluations, and Community Notes.
- Set a custom home screen (landing page) for each PIE instance
- Toggle on/off a "return to top" button on articles (they can sometimes get very long)
